            <p>A stunning natural escape from the city, the Three Eyes National Park provides a clear view of the Taino underground caverns that were once utilized for ceremonies or retreat. The Taino used to refer to these three freshwater, iridescent blue lagoons as "eyes," because of their oval shapes. A winding staircase at the entrance leads to a labyrinth of caverns.</p>
